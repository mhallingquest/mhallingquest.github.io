<h1> Marketing Campaign Data Analysis </h1>
  <h3>The Business Context</h3>
  <p><strong>Introduction</strong>: ABC Company is considering new items for the fast-food menu. The CEO aims to understand which promotional campaigns are most effective across different markets to optimize customer response and sales.<br>
     <strong>Purpose</strong>: The main goal is to design a targeted promotional strategy that maximizes customer engagement and sales for new menu items.
  </p>
 
  <h3>The Business Routine</h3>
  <p><strong>Current Routine</strong>: Currently, ABC tests three types of promotional campaigns across various locations, each with distinct market sizes and store ages. Weekly sales data for the first four weeks of each campaign is tracked, providing a snapshot of short-term promotional effectiveness.
  </p>

  <h3>The Business Question</h3>
  <p><strong>Key Challenge</strong>: Which promotion yields the highest sales and customer engagement, and how can ABC Company increase response rates and lead quality in future campaigns? Additionally, we need to understand which market factors (size, store age, etc.) influence campaign success across channels.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Data Insights</h3>
  <p><strong>Analysis Findings</strong>: Using statistical models and visualizations:</p>

  <p><li> <strong>Promotion Effectiveness</strong>: By comparing weekly sales data across promotions, we identified that promotion 1 drives the most sales in the specific market segments.</li>
     <li> <strong>Market Segmentation</strong>: Sales performance differs by market size (small, medium, large), and older stores often perform differently in response rates. Insights from regression analysis reveal significant predictors of campaign success (e.g., age of store, market size).</li>
  </p>
  
  <h3>The Decisions & Actions</h3>
  <p><strong>Decisions</strong>: Based on analysis, ABC should prioritize certain promotions in specific markets. For instance, the promotions may perform better in large markets, while they are not as effective in medium markets. <br>
     <strong>Actions</strong>: Implement a dynamic, data-driven approach to promotions by aligning specific campaigns with high-performing segments. Also, refine the promotional messaging and delivery channels according to market preferences and store characteristics.</p>

  <h3>The Business Impact</h3>
  <p> <strong>Impact</strong>: This tailored approach is expected to increase response rates, leading to higher weekly sales and enhanced customer engagement. Over time, this strategy will refine ABCâ€™s market understanding, improving lead quality and maximizing returns on promotional investments.
